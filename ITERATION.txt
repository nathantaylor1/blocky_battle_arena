A lot of the feedback that I recieved was centered around not understanding the controls of the game. 
In order to solve this problem, I realized I needed to implement a tutorial level to explain the
controls and basic mechanics of the game. This caused a problem since the game is randomly generated,
because there wasnt a good way to setup a specific area to show off the mechanics of the game. To solve
this issue, I ended up creating a separate tutorial level accessed from the main menu.
Another important piece of feedback was that the goals of the game werent clear. So i wrote out an 
"Objectives" section in the tutorial and specifically wrote out the word "Score" next to the score
counter to help make it more clear. I also created some of my own textures and sprites to help make the
enemies and breakable blocks stand out more.
